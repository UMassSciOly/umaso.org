# UMASO Website

New version of the UMASO website. Currently in development.
- website-revamp branch will be the "development" branch
- main branch will be the production branch (github pages deploys that branch automatically)
- old-website is just for saving the old website

During development, make branches for each feature off of the website-revamp branch. Commit and push often to avoid too many merge conflicts. Also pull regularly if you feel that someone else is editing.

Merge conflicts can be settled in github.
